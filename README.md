# emailheaderinspector
An Office Outlook add-in to get the originating IP Address of an email and other properties from the email header.

EHI is used to list the properties from an email header. Some of these properties are not immediately listed in the default email view. This add-on fetches the email header and displays select properties from the email header. In addition it also fetches the IP address of the sender and attempts to map this IP address to a geolocation.

To run, clone the project and dotnet run or start from visual studio.
